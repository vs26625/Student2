## Comparison of CB Pseudo Code to Python with descriptions

Command Vocabulary | Pseudo code         | Python                 | Purpose
Output       | DISPLAY(expression) | print(expression, end=" ") | Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. Python defaults to newline, thus the end=" "
Input        | a ← INPUT()         | a = input(prompt)      | Accepts a value from the user and returns it to the variable a.
Assignment   |	a ← expression	   | a = expression         | Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a.
Selection    | IF (expression)     | if expression:         | Run commands in the code block associated with the selection
Iteration n times     |	REPEAT n TIMES      | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times
Iteration expression  | REPEAT UNTIL (expression) |	while expression: |  Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true
List Assignment | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3] | list = [expression1, expression2, expression3] | Assigns 3 values to list, value can be literal or expressions
First index in List     |	list[1] | list[0] | Access the 1st element in the list[].  FYI, most programming languages start a zero.
Last index in List    | list[LENGTH(list)] | list[len(list) - 1] | Access the last element in the list[].  If you start at zero, last element is length - 1.
Define Procedure      | PROCEDURE name (parameter) | def name(parameter): |  Create a procedure containing a sequence of programming instructions.
Expression equals     |	a = b	| a == b  | Evaluate if assigned value of a equals assigned value of b
Expression not equals |	a ≠ b	| a != b  | Evaluate if assigned value of a is NOT equal to assigned value of b

### Pseudo code IF Code Block
```
a ← 1
b ← 1

IF (a = b) {
   DISPLAY("A equals B")
}
```


```python
# Python code if block to match Pseudo Code
a = 1
b = 1
if (a == b):
    # Python uses indent to establish code block, Teacher use tab key
    print("A equals B")
```

    A equals B


## Hacks Learned
> Key Learnings.  It is very important that you become fluent in " Vocabulary" and researching problems.

- Learned basic sets of code such as wsl (type of coding source I use for my computer), cd (change directory {file}), help (provides code), clear (clears code in terminal), mkdir (make directory), rmdir (remove directory), and dir/ls (see what is in directory).

- Learned what each tool is used for such as vscode (used to code my blog), command prompt/powershell (used to code in general), vscode terminal (used to save codes in my blog and to code in general), and github (used as a code history to save all your codes).
