- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with ability to operate Development Tools on it or within the Cloud.
- GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.

- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Code in your blog.
