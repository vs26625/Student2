## Summary of Accomplishments
> Update on how this week went  
Me and my partners went above and beyond by creating a markdown table on our home page (since it was not taught to us) and we all shared what we struggled with and our solutions to this weeks problems.
 My computer was working fine, however, I did struggle trying to open my website since using the https://0.0.0.0:4200/student webstite was not working. 
 Turns out, it was the 0.0.0.0 that was troubling some of the other wsl students and I. Instead of 0.0.0.0, I now use "localhost:4200." Another issue I struggled with was resizing my freeform photo. With the help of my teammates, we realized the formula for the photo was wrong and that to resize it, the correct formula required the witdh and the height at the end of the formula instead of the beginning. 
 My blog home page is filled with my partners, freeform picture, hobbies, and class schedule.
I maintain my notes and tangibles by  adding links and a daily plans everytime I start class. This is so that I have everything set for everyday of class
